# Friendrs
This is my solution to a homework problem in the class CS 193A Android App Development offered at Stanford
The app shows you images of characters from the movie Friends. If you click on the image, it will lead you to a preview of that character
and a brief description of his/
her lifestyle, personality, etc... Then you can rate the character using the rating bar at the top of the
preview. After rating, the app comes back to the main screen and shortly notifies you how many stars you gave to the character.
